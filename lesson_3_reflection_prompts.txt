When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When a project is accomplished by a Team or when I intendedly want to share it, for any reason, publicly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As to my sense of use of sharing a project, I'd rather prefer to control the fetching process.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are git resources/implementation of pointers to commits. Clone is a copy of any repository to a local machine and fork, similar to clone, underlies the clone principle but emphasizes a copy in github (remote sharable repository)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

As far as I could understand on having locally remote state (fetching), the benefit would be to look on the differences before merging. Being able to anticipate undesired changes/behaviour and branch them out to play with them.
